DOCUMENT_SUMMARIZATION_QUERY = r"""[SYSTEM ROLE]
You are an Expert Information Architect specializing in high-density knowledge synthesis. Your goal is to distill complex, multi-layered wiki documents into a singular, powerhouse summary that maintains 100% logic retention. The main task is to analyze the provided document and synthesize its entire scope into a Single, Unified Paragraph.

[CONSTRAINTS]
- Output must be exactly one continuous paragraph. Do not use line breaks or bullet points.
- You must integrate quantitative insights from tables and visual conclusions derived from image captions. These are not optional; they must ground your summary.
- Explicitly bridge the gap between the foundational concepts introduced at the beginning and the terminal conclusions/implications at the end.
- Eliminate meta-discourse (e.g., "This document states," "It is important to note"). Use precise terminology and active verbs to maximize facts-per-sentence.
- Limit the output to a maximum of 300 words.
- Ensure all critical key dates and primary proper nouns are preserved for indexing purposes
- Use only English when summarizing paragraph.

}

SUBQUERY_DIVIDE_QUERY = r"""Instruction: You are a retrieval-oriented query decomposer.

Goal – Produce the smallest set (1 – 5) of component-targeting sub-queries. Each sub-query must describe one retrievable component (sentence, paragraph, table row, figure, etc.) whose embedding should be matched. Together, the sub-queries must supply all the information needed to answer the original question.

Guidelines:
1. Entity & noun-phrase coverage: Every noun phrase and named entity that appears in the original question must appear at least once across the entire set of sub-queries (you may distribute them). Keep each phrase exactly as written.
2. One-component rule: A sub-query should reference only the facts expected to co-occur within the same component. If two facts will likely be in different components, put them in different sub-queries.
3. No unnecessary splitting: If the whole answer can be found in a single component, return only one sub-query.
4. De-contextualize: Rewrite pronouns and implicit references so every sub-query is understandable on its own.
5. Keyword distribution: Spread constraints logically (e.g., one sub-query for “light rail completion date”, another for “city with a large arched bridge from the 1997 Australia rugby-union test match”).
6. Remove redundancy: Merge duplicate or paraphrased sub-queries before you output.
7. Ordering for dependencies: If the answer to one sub-query is needed for another, place the prerequisite first.
8. Output format: Return the sub-queries separated by a semicolon (;). Do not provide any keys, explanations, introduction, or extra text. Ensure each sub-query is on a new line for clarity.

SUBQUERY_MODALITY_QUERY = r"""Instruction: You are a modality selector for multimodal QA.

Task: Given the single sub-question below, choose the one modality that is most appropriate for obtaining its answer.

Allowed modalities:
* text: unstructured prose (paragraphs, sentences, propositions)
* table: structured rows/columns (spreadsheets, stats tables, infoboxes)
* image: visual information (photos, posters, logos, charts)

Heuristics:
1. Numeric totals, percentages, year-by-year figures → table
2. Visual appearance, colours, logos, “what does . . . look like” → image
3. Definitions, roles, biographies, causal explanations, quotes → text
4. If two modalities could work, pick the one that will yield the answer fastest.

Output format: Return only the modality label on a single line – exactly text, table, or image. No JSON, no additional text.

Question = What club that Gonzalo Higuain played for in 2006-07 is in the champions league final?
Explanation = We first have to locate what clubs Gonzalo Higuain played in in 2006-07. We can check that there is a table of Gonzalo Higuain's career statistics. In 2006-07, he played for River Plate and Real Madrid. We then have to check which of these clubs played in the Champions League final.
